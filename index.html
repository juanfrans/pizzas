      There is no denying that New York City has had a long standing connection to the Pizza slice as one of its
          hallmark
          culinary offerings and culture symbols.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          The pizza slice even has an economic tie to the city, suggested by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Principle">Pizza Principle</a> - a correlation between
          the price of a slice and that of a subway ride.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          What is it that makes “the best’ slices? Researcher Jared Lander set out to find the reason for highly rated pizzas,
          looking at
          location, price and the type of fuel used for the oven.
          <a href="https://www.jaredlander.com/content/2010/03/Pizza-Thesis-Jared-Lander.pdf">Lander's research</a> found that Midtown pizzas are slightly
          less favorable and that coal fired ovens draw larger crowds, but also concluded that they were able to discover much
          differentiation in quality. They suggested that “as is the case with wine, people in general do not have a
          sophisticated
          enough palate to fully appreciate the many facets of pizza.”

          Pizza is a food loved by many, and lists rating the best slices in town are often compiled . We decided to
          create our
          own aggregate list, combining 4 different articles published on <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/the-best-pizza-in-new-york-city#map=show">Thrillist</a>,

          We went out to try the best pizzas in the city. Using photogrammetry, we re-created the slices in 3D so that you can view these slices in augmented reality.
