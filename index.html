        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          There is no denying that New York City has had a long standing connection to the Pizza slice as one of its hallmark
          culinary offerings and culture symbols.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          The pizza slice even has an economic tie to the city, suggested by the Pizza Principle - a correlation between the price
          of a slice and that of a subway ride.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          What is it that makes “the best’ slices? One researcher set out to find the reason for highly rated pizzas, looking at
          location, price and the type of fuel used for the oven. This research found that Midtown pizzas are slightly less
          favorable and that coal fired ovens draw larger crowds, but also concluded that they were able to discover much
          differentiation in quality. They suggested that “as is the case with wine, people in general do not have a sophisticated
          enough palate to fully appreciate the many facets of pizza.”
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          Pizza is a food loved by many, and lists rating the best slices in town are often compiled . We decided to create our
          own aggregate list, combining 4 different articles published on thrillist, Eater, Time Out, NYT, and a personal list
          made by a friend and independent Pizza lover Yotam Hadar. We went out to capture the best pizzas in the city using
          photogrammetry, so that you can enjoy a vivid documentation of these slices with AR.

          There are x businesses within the five boroughs that offer pizza in the city, according to the foursquare API. Out of
          these thousands, there are several famous spots who come up in all the lists rating the best pizzas in the city. 60
          restaurants appear in the lists we looked at for the best pizzas, and from that group only 23 restaurants appear in more
          than one list.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f5-ns lh-copy center">
          For this article, we looked at lists by The New York Times, TimeOut, Eater, Thrillist, and an independant list created
          by our friend and pizza enthusiast Yotam Hadar.
